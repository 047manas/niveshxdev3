### OTP Verification Step
- Users receive their OTP email
- If they notice an error in their email or other details, they can click "Back to Account Info"
- This takes them back to Step 1 where they can correct any information
- Form data is cleared to prevent conflicts

### Company Profile Step
- Users can click "Start Over" if they want to use completely different account details
- This restarts the entire onboarding process from the beginning

- Prevents duplicate registrations
