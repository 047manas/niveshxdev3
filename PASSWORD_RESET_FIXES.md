# Password Reset Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Environment Variable Issue**
- ✅ Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` 
- ✅ Changed from placeholder "NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL" to actual URL `http://localhost:3003`
- ✅ Updated default fallback URL in forgot-password API

### 2. **Database Collection Inconsistency**
- ✅ **Problem**: Forgot password was looking in `new_users` collection, but verified users are in `users` collection
- ✅ **Solution**: Updated both forgot-password and reset-password APIs to check both collections
- ✅ **Flow**: First checks `users` collection, then falls back to `pending_users`

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Added password strength validation (minimum 8 characters)
- ✅ Improved error messages for users
- ✅ Added better logging for debugging
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors

### 4. **Enhanced Email Template**
- ✅ Added expiration notice (1 hour)
- ✅ Improved email styling with clickable link
- ✅ Better user guidance

### 5. **UI Improvements**
- ✅ Added password requirements hint
- ✅ Better success/error messaging
- ✅ Improved user feedback during process

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Forgot Password Flow**
1. User enters email on forgot password page
2. System checks both `users` and `pending_users` collections
3. If user found, generates secure reset token
4. Sends email with reset link (valid for 1 hour)
5. Returns success message (doesn't reveal if user exists)

### 2. **Reset Password Flow**
1. User clicks link from email
2. System validates token and expiration
3. User enters new password (with validation)
4. Password is hashed and updated
5. Reset token is removed from database
6. User is redirected to login

### 3. **Security Features**
- ✅ Secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes
- ✅ Tokens are hashed before storage
- ✅ 1-hour expiration on reset tokens
- ✅ Tokens are deleted after use
- ✅ No user existence disclosure
- ✅ Password strength validation

## Testing the Fix

1. **Test Forgot Password**:
   - Go to login page
   - Click "Forgot Password"
   - Enter your email address
   - Check email for reset link

2. **Test Reset Password**:
   - Click the link from email
   - Enter new password (8+ characters)
   - Confirm password
   - Submit and verify redirect to login

3. **Test Security**:
   - Try using an expired token (should fail)
   - Try using an invalid token (should fail)
   - Try with mismatched passwords (should fail)

## Collections Supported
- ✅ `users` collection (verified users)
- ✅ `pending_users` collection (unverified users)
- ✅ Seamless fallback between collections
